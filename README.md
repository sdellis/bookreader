#Bookreader, NexGen

With recent releases of the IIIF Image and Presentation APIs, and continuing progress in the area, there is a need
to bring the BookReader in alignment with those specifications.  This will simplify BookReader integrations for those 
who implement the server-side IIIF APIs, and will allow the BookReader to provide new features that are enabled by 
using the IIIF specs.

To help scope the project, these enhancements to the BookReader cover two basic use-cases, which is the: 

1.  Reading of sequenced content manifests on a variety of devices
2.  Authoring and annotating of manifests on a variety of devices

There may be better tools for other use cases.  For example, [Mirador](http://github.com/iiif/m2) would provide better tools for scholarly comparison of images across repositories.

The original Internet Archive BookReader is used to view books from the Internet Archive
online and can also be used to view other books.
