#IIIF 2.0 Bookreader

[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/sdellis/bookreader?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

With recent releases of the IIIF [Image](http://iiif.io/api/image/2.0/) and [Presentation](http://iiif.io/api/presentation/2.0/) APIs, and continuing progress in the area, there is a need
to bring the BookReader in alignment with those specifications (or perhaps start over, if need be).  This will simplify BookReader integrations for those  who implement the server-side IIIF APIs, and will allow the BookReader to provide new features that are enabled by using the IIIF specs.

There may be better tools for other use cases, and we don't want to duplicate effort.  For example, [Mirador](http://github.com/iiif/m2) would provide better tools for scholarly comparison of images across repositories.  To help scope the project, please add or comment on [issues in this repository](https://github.com/sdellis/bookreader/issues).
